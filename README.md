# Sudoku

### Play this classic game, styled based on the New York Times version of the game.

## How to Play
* Head over to the site by clicking [here](https://kailahk.github.io/sudoku/)
* Once you choose your level, you will be directed to the game page and the timer will start.
* To play, click around the board to highlight the square you want to place a number in. Then click the number on the keyboard that you want to show up in the highlighted square.
* If you switch your keyboard to candidate mode, you can list the possible numbers that each square may hold.
* The object of the game is to fill every square with a number (1-9) such that there is only one of each number in every row, column, and box (9 squares shown by the grey borders on the board).
* Once every square is correctly filled with a number (not a candidate), the player wins and the timer stops.
* If the player places a number in a square that already has that number in the same row, column, or box, it will be highlighted as a conflict until the number is changed or deleted.
